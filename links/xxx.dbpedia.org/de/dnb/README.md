Deutsche Nationalbibliothek
==============


The German National Library is building a linked data service that in the long run will permit the semantic web community to use the entire stock of national bibliographic data, including all authority data. It is endeavouring to make a contribution to the global information infrastructure with this new data service and thus laying the foundations for modern commercial and non-commercial web services.

The German National Library is committed to making a significant contribution to ensuring the stability and reliability of the "linked data cloud" by providing data of high quality, most of which has been intellectually generated. The German National Library has been supplying its data in the RDF standard via the Linked Data Service since 2010. By offering RDF as an equal status export format, it allows users and user groups to re-use its data in a way which requires no knowledge of bibliographic formats. The service is subject to ongoing further development and optimisation at the technical, content and organisational levels. Besides developing its own service, the German National Library is also actively involved in the Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative.
