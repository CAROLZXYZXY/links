European Nature Information System
===============

The European nature information system, EUNIS, brings together European data from several databases and organisations into three interlinked modules on sites, species and habitat types.

The EUNIS information system is part of the European [Biodiversity data centre (BDC)](http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/biodiversity/dc) and it is a contribution to the knowledge base for implementing the EU and global biodiversity strategies and the [7th Environmental Action Programme.](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/newprg/)

The EUNIS information system provides access to the publicly available data in the EUNIS database. The information includes:

* Data on species, habitat types and designated sites compiled in the framework of Natura 2000 (EU Habitats and Birds Directives)
* The EUNIS habitat classification
* Data from material compiled by the [European Topic Centre of Biological Diversity](http://bd.eionet.europa.eu/)
* Information on species, habitat types and designated sites mentioned in relevant international conventions and in the IUCN Red Lists;
* Specific data collected in the framework of the EEA's reporting activities, which also constitute a core set of data to be updated periodically, e.g. Eionet priority dataflow Nationally designated areas (CDDA).
