World Bank Linked Data
====================

The data that is collected from [The World Bank](http://worldbank.org/) is composed of [World Bank Indicators](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-bank-indicators), [World Bank Finances](https://finances.worldbank.org/), [World Bank Projects and Operations](http://www.worldbank.org/projects) and [World Bank Climate Change](http://climatechange.worldbank.org/) data. It was collected by making requests to World Bank API endpoints using the XML format preference.

The data can be used to derive statistical information that’s consumable by humans in the form of charts, or compared to statistics from other organizations.

The purpose of the World Bank Linked Data here is to allow consumers and publishers to merge this data with theirs or link to for more information.

The dataset are updated monthly to check for changes in The World Bank’s API output. The last update was made on 2012-08-10.
