#Bookmashup 

The RDF book mashup demonstrates how Web 2.0 data sources like Amazon,
Google or Yahoo can be integrated into the Semantic Web.

The RDF book mashup makes information about books, their authors,
reviews, and online bookstores available on the Semantic Web. This
information can be used by RDF tools and you can link to it from your
own Semantic Web data.

This dataset is part of the Linking Open Drug Data (LODD) project. More information on the project and the approach for publishing the data can be found in the original research paper: Jentzsch, Anja, et al. "Linking Open Drug Data." I-SEMANTICS. 2009.

Note: The last update of the dataset has been done in 2011, thus it doesn't contain any recent updates in the original DrugBank.ca data.
