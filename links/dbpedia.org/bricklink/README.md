bricklink
==============

These are legacy links of bricklink copied *as is* from  old releases.
So far, there has been no maintainer for them, which is a pity.
Do you have a better description for this linkset? Can you contribute better links?
Then have a look at the [how-to wiki page](https://github.com/dbpedia/links/wiki/How-To-Contribute-Links-to-DBpedia)  

More information about the links might be found [here](http://data.kasabi.com)
