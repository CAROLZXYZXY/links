Transparency International Linked Data
=================

The data that is collected from [Transparency International](http://transparency.org/) is composed of [Corruption Perceptions Index](http://www.transparency.org/research/cpi/) data. Both data and accompanying metadata was collected by downloading the Excel datasets and PDF reports from their website.

The data can be used to derive statistical information that’s consumable by humans in the form of charts (see also the World Bank Linked Data’s Tools section), or compared to statistics from other organizations.

The purpose of the Transparency International Linked Data here is to allow consumers and publishers to merge this data with theirs or link to for more information.

Given that this is the initial Linked Data release, there is no regularity in how these datesets are extracted, transformed and loaded. The last update was made on 2012-10-03.
