DBpedia-Links
=============
A repo that contains links and alternative classifications for DBpedia.

# About

Links are the key enabler for retrieval of related information on the Web of Data and DBpedia is one of the central interlinking hubs in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. The DBpedia-Links repository maintains linksets between DBpedia and other LOD datasets. System for maintenance, update and quality assurance of the linksets are in place and can be explored further.

In this README, we will include descriptions on how to download and use the links, run all available tools as well as pointers to the most important documentation. if questions remain please use the [GitHub Issue tracker](http://github.com/dbpedia/dbpedia-links/issues). If you want to give us more feedback, feel free to use the [DBpedia Discussion mailinglist](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dbpedia-discussion).

## Why upload your links?
All links you are contributing will be loaded (after a quality check) into the main DBpedia datasets and therefore will link to your data. Users of DBpedia can then better find your data. Also we will be able to tell you, which other external databases link to your data.
