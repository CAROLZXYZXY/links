DBpedia-Links
=============
A repo that contains links and alternative classifications for DBpedia.

# About

Links are the key enabler for retrieval of related information on the Web of Data and DBpedia is one of the central interlinking hubs in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. The DBpedia-Links repository maintains linksets between DBpedia and other LOD datasets. System for maintenance, update and quality assurance of the linksets are in place and can be explored further.

In this README, we will include descriptions on how to download and use the links, run all available tools as well as pointers to the most important documentation. if questions remain please use the [GitHub Issue tracker](http://github.com/dbpedia/dbpedia-links/issues). If you want to give us more feedback, feel free to use the [DBpedia Discussion mailinglist](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dbpedia-discussion).

# /TODO PLEASE REMOVE, too long, two sentences are enough/ Why contribute 

If you have a large dataset, contributing to DBpedia-Links might prove useful. 

Currently, DBpedia acts as central interlinking hub for the emerging Web of Data. It provides localized descriptions for over 28 million things along with links to other data sources on the Web.

The DBpedia Links resource can support various tasks which are dependent on cross-linked information. For example, data fusion tasks can be supported in generation of unified views for entities by incorporating information from different sources. It can also aid agents in navigating from one data source to another, or support learning tasks, such as learning entity resolution or link discovery, by providing rich structures and information for learning from multiple sources. Moreover, Web content can be enriched with annotations and references from DBpedia. Since DBpedia Links provides links to other sources, the annotation references can be substituted with links from other sources and in turn provide multi-dataset enrichment.
 

## Why upload your links?
All links you are contributing will be loaded (after a quality check) into the main DBpedia datasets and therefore will link to your data. Users of DBpedia can then better find your data. Also we will be able to tell you, which other external databases link to your data.
